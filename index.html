      developer, sometimes called more recently a coder (especially in more
      informal contexts), is a person who creates computer software. The term
      computer developer can refer to a specialist in one area of computers, or
      to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. A developer's
      most oft-used computer language (e.g., Assembly, COBOL, C, C++, C#,
      JavaScript, Lisp, Python) may be prefixed to the term developer. Some who
      work with web programming languages also prefix their titles with web.
      developer vaibhav A range of occupations that involve programming also
      often require a range of other, similar skills, for example: (software)
      developer, web developer, mobile applications developer, embedded firmware
      developer, software engineer, computer scientist, game developer, game
      developer and software analyst. The use of the term developer as applied
      to these positions is sometimes considered an insulting simplification or
      even derogatory. British countess and mathematician Ada Lovelace is often
      considered to be the first computer developer, as she was the first to
      publish part of a program (specifically an algorithm) intended for
      implementation on Charles Babbage's analytical engine, in October 1842.
      The algorithm was used to calculate Bernoulli numbers.[7] Because
      Babbage's machine was never completed as a functioning standard in
      Lovelace's time, she unfortunately never had the opportunity to see the
      algorithm in action. The ENIAC programming team, consisting of Kay
      McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas and Ruth
      Lichterman were the first regularly working developers.[8][9]
      International developers' Day is celebrated annually on 7 January.[10] In
      2009, the government of Russia decreed a professional annual holiday known
      as developers' Day to be celebrated on 13 September (12 September in leap
      years). It had already been an unofficial holiday before that in many
      countries. The word software was used as early as 1953, but did not
      regularly appear in print until the 1960s.[11] Before this time, computers
      were programmed either by customers or the few commercial computer
      manufacturers of the time, such as UNIVAC and IBM. The first company
      founded to specifically provide software products and services was the
      Computer Usage Company, in 1955.[12] The software industry expanded in the
      early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in
      mass-produced quantities. Universities, governments and businesses created
      a demand for software. Many of these programs were written in-house by
      full-time staff developers; some were distributed freely between users of
      a particular machine for no charge. And others were developed on a
      commercial basis. Other firms, such as Computer Sciences Corporation
      (founded in 1959) also started to grow. The computer/hardware
      manufacturers soon started bundling operating systems, system software and
      programming environments with their machines.[citation needed] The
      industry expanded greatly with the rise of the personal computer ("PC") in
      the mid-1970s, which brought computing to the average office worker. In
      the following years the PC also helped create a constantly-growing market
      for games, applications and utilities software. CP/M, later replaced by
      DOS, Microsoft's Windows popular operating system of the time.[13]
      portfolio developer vaibhav In the early years of the 21st century,
      another successful business model has arisen for hosted software, called
      software-as-a-service, or SaaS. From the point of view of producers of
      some proprietary software, SaaS reduces the concerns about unauthorized
      copying, since it can only be accessed through the Web, and by definition,
      no client software is loaded onto the end user's PC. SaaS is typically run
      out of the cloud. Computer developers write, test, debug, and maintain the
      detailed instructions, called computer programs, that computers must
      follow to perform their functions. developers also conceive, design, and
      test logical structures for solving problems by computer. Many technical
      innovations in programming — advanced computing technologies and
      sophisticated new languages and programming tools — have redefined the
      role of a developer and elevated much of the programming work done today.
      Job titles and descriptions may vary, depending on the organization.
      developers work in many settings, including corporate information
      technology ("IT") departments, big software companies, small service firms
      and government entities of all sizes. Many professional developers also
      work for consulting companies at client sites as contractors. Licensing is
      not typically required to work as a developer, although professional
      certifications are commonly held by developers. Programming is widely
      considered a profession (although some[who?] authorities disagree on the
      grounds that only careers with legal licensing requirements count as a
      profession). developers' work varies widely depending on the type of
      business for which they are writing programs. For example, the
      instructions involved in updating financial records are very different
      from those required to duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots
      training in a flight simulator. Simple programs can be written in a few
      hours, more complex ones may require more than a year of work, while
      others are never considered 'complete' but rather are continuously
      improved as long as they stay in use. In most cases, several developers
      work together as a team under a senior developer's supervision. portfolio
      A software engineer writing JavaScript portfolio developer vaibhav
      developers write programs according to the specifications determined
      primarily by more senior developers and by systems analysts. After the
      design process is complete, it is the job of the developer to convert that
      design into a logical series of instructions that the computer can follow.
      The developer codes these instructions in one of many programming
      languages. Different programming languages are used depending on the
      purpose of the program. COBOL, for example, is commonly used for business
      applications that typically run on mainframe and midrange computers,
      whereas Fortran is used in science and engineering. C++ and Python are
      widely used for both scientific and business applications. Java, C#, JS
      and PHP are popular programming languages for Web and business
      applications. developers generally know more than one programming language
      and, because many languages are similar, they often can learn new
      languages relatively easily. In practice, developers often are referred to
      by the language they know, e.g. as Java developers, or by the type of
      function they perform or environment in which they work: for example,
      database developers, mainframe developers, or Web developers. When making
      changes to the source code that programs are made up of, developers need
      to make other developers aware of the task that the routine is to perform.
      They do this by inserting comments in the source code so that others can
      understand the program more easily and by documenting their code. To save
      work, developers often use libraries of basic code that can be modified or
      customized for a specific application. This approach yields more reliable
      and consistent programs and increases developers' productivity by
      eliminating some routine steps. Testing and debugging developers test a
      program by running it and looking for bugs (errors). As they are
      identified, the developer usually makes the appropriate corrections, then
      rechecks the program until an acceptably low level and severity of bugs
      remain. This process is called testing and debugging. These are important
      parts of every developer's job. developers may continue to fix these
      problems throughout the life of a program. Updating, repairing, modifying,
      and expanding existing programs is sometimes called maintenance
      programming. developers may contribute to user guides and online help, or
      they may work with technical writers to do such work. Application versus
      system programming Computer developers often are grouped into two broad
      types: application developers and systems developers. Application
      developers write programs to handle a specific job, such as a program to
      track inventory within an organization. They also may revise existing
      packaged software or customize generic applications which are frequently
      purchased from independent software vendors. Systems developers, in
      contrast, write programs to maintain and control computer systems
      software, such as operating systems and database management systems. These
      workers make changes in the instructions that determine how the network,
      workstations, and CPU of the system handle the various jobs they have been
      given and how they communicate with peripheral equipment such as printers
      and disk drives. developer vaibhav Types of software portfolio developers
      in software development companies may work directly with experts from
      various fields to create software – either programs designed for specific
      clients or packaged software for general use – ranging from video games to
      educational software to programs for desktop publishing and financial
      planning. Programming of packaged software constitutes one of the most
      rapidly growing segments of the computer services industry. Some companies
      or organizations – even small ones – have set up their own IT team to
      ensure the design and development of in-house software to answer to very
      specific needs from their internal end-users, especially when existing
      software are not suitable or too expensive. This is for example the case
      in research laboratories.[citation needed] In some organizations,
      particularly small ones, people commonly known as developer analysts are
      responsible for both the systems analysis and the actual programming work.
      The transition from a mainframe environment to one that is based primarily
      on personal computers (PCs) has blurred the once rigid distinction between
      the developer and the user. Increasingly, adept end users are taking over
      many of the tasks previously performed by developers. For example, the
      growing use of packaged software, such as spreadsheet and database
      management software packages, allows users to write simple programs to
      access data and perform calculations.[citation needed] developer vaibhav
      In addition, the rise of the Internet has made web development a huge part
      of the programming field. Currently more software applications are web
      applications that can be used by anyone with a web browser.[citation
      needed] Examples of such applications include the Google search service,
      the Outlook.com e-mail service, and the Flickr photo-sharing service.
      developer vaibhav Programming editors, also known as source code editors,
      are text editors that are specifically designed for developers or
      developers for writing the source code of an application or a program.
      Most of these editors include features useful for developers, which may
      include color syntax highlighting, auto indentation, auto-complete,
      bracket matching, syntax check, and allows plug-ins. These features aid
      the users during coding, debugging and testing.[17] portfolio developer
